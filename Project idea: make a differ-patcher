## Make a Differ-Patcher

[General information about Iron Forger](https://hackpad.com/Iron-Forger-kEmauANGcV5)

Build a tool to compare two text files and generate a diff — a file that concisely specifies the differences between the two other files.

 1. A diff file has the following structure:

   2. A **header** of two lines, giving the names of the two original text files and indicating which is considered the "original" file from which the other is being derived. The original file is called the "from-file" and is marked with minus signs; the "to-file" is marked with plus-signs:          --- from-file         +++ to-file 
   2. A series of **hunks** of differences between the files. Each hunk has two parts:
     3. It begins with a line beginning and ending with a pair of at-signs (`@`), between which are listed the numbers of the lines in each file described by the hunk and the number of consecutive changes. 
     3. After that there is a list of whole lines, each of which prefaced with a plus or a minus to indicate whether it is being added to the to-file or removed from it. Here is an example of a hunk:          @@ -3 +3 @@         -some text         +other words  This hunk says: The single line at line 3 of the from-file is being removed and a single new line is being added to the to-file. The line being removed is "some text" and the line being added is "other words".
     3. Hunks can also include lines of **context**, for the benefit of human readers. Context lines always begin with a space. They are found in both the from-file and the to-file, and strictly speaking they are not part of the diff.  In          @@ -2,0 +3 @@         +some words  the expression -2,0 +3 means that line 2 in the from-file corresponds to line 3 in the to-file, and nothing is removed from the from-file at the position specified, but one line is added in the to-file at the position specified. The default change is one line — to be removed, if specified for the from-file; added, if specified for the to-file. If the change is of something other than the default, it is           @@ -3 +2,0 @@         -a problem to remove   the expression -3 +2,0 means that there is a single line removed at position line 3 in the from-file, and nothing is added in its place, line 2 in the to-file. 
### Other ideas

 1. If diff functionality is already available in your programming language of choice, build another tool to "patch" a text file using a diff — to generate the other of the two files that was used in producing the original diff
 1. Add diff functionality to your [version control](https://hackpad.com/Week-3-Make-a-Local-Version-Control-System-NZ1n98nFktQ) project from last week.
